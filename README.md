# Other features.

The application implements some layout algorithms for organizing graphs.
- Circular Layout
- Radial Layout
- Tree Layout
- Grid Layout
- Spectral Layout

In addition to implementing a Layout Algorithm based on springs and directed force:
- Kamada-Kawai Algorithm
- Fruchterman-Reingold Algorithm
