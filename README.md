A simple tool for building and visualizing Markov Chains as directed graphs. 
Define states and transitions, then visualize the structure in an interactive, easy-to-use interface.

This tool allows users to define states and transitions between them, creating a clear, visual representation of the Markov Chain. By interacting with an intuitive, drag-and-drop interface, users can easily build the structure of their chain, adding or removing states and setting transition probabilities between them. Once the Markov Chain is constructed users can explore the relationships between states and see how the chain evolves over time.


# Execution
